    <h1>How it all started</h1>
    <p>
        NeoEats began as a small family-owned restaurant with a passion for fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. Our founders
        believed in creating delicious meals that not only satisfied hunger but also supported local farmers and
        sustainable practices. Over the years, we've grown into a beloved community spot, known for our innovative dishes
        and warm atmosphere. Join us as we continue to share our story and our love for great food!
